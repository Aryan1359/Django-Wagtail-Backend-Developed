## ðŸ“˜ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Project Title:** Django + Wagtail + React + Bootstrap Base Template

**Development Environment:** Anaconda VM (local), Docker (deployment), AWS (cloud hosting)

---

### 1. Introduction

**1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this SRS is to define a reusable web application template that includes Django, Wagtail CMS, React frontend, and Bootstrap for styling. This base template should be easy to clone and use for new projects, support local development using Anaconda, and be deployable using Docker on AWS or similar platforms.

**1.2 Scope**
This template will:

- Support CMS-based content management using Wagtail
- Provide modern frontend UI with React and Bootstrap
- Offer headless/hybrid architecture via REST APIs or Wagtailâ€™s content API
- Be easily deployable with Docker and configurable with environment variables
- Include useful Wagtail extensions like StreamField, Image Gallery, and Forms

**1.3 Audience**
Targeted at beginner to intermediate developers who want a fast and scalable foundation for full-stack Django applications with CMS features and rich front-end interactivity.

**1.4 Definitions**

- **SRS:** Software Requirements Specification
- **CMS:** Content Management System
- **DRF:** Django REST Framework

### 2. Overall Description

**2.1 System Features**

- Modular architecture with clearly separated backend and frontend
- Editable content pages via Wagtail admin
- REST API endpoints for frontend integration
- Styled UI components using Bootstrap 5
- Dockerized for consistent environment

**2.2 User Classes and Characteristics**

- **Developers:** Use the base to create new projects
- **Content Editors:** Use Wagtail admin to manage site content
- **End Users:** Visit and interact with the deployed site

**2.3 Operating Environment**

- Python 3.11+ (Conda)
- Node.js (LTS version)
- Django 5.x
- Wagtail 6.x
- React 18.x
- Bootstrap 5.x
- Redis (for Celery)
- PostgreSQL (default DB)
- Docker (v20+), Docker Compose (v2+)
- AWS, Heroku, Render, or DigitalOcean for deployment

**2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints**

- Must run on Anaconda virtual environments
- Must be compatible with Docker for deployment
- Code should be modular, readable, and reusable

**2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**
